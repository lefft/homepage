intuition/summary
~~~~~~~~~~~
write a v short expt'al paper, display a paragraph at a time linearly to one group of turkers; display the same paper in the "onion" style to another group, ask them both comprehension q's and q's about did they find it convincing. hypothesis: for convincing papers, no diff; for unconvincing papers, onion subj's believe conclusions less. BUT hopefully would be no diff in level of understanding, regardless of whether paper is convincing.


design
~~~~~~~~~~~
have ppl answer comp q's before moving on(?)
(all at the end cd be bad -- ppl just flip thru; altho cd manipulate this too...)
2x2 factorial design:
	- format: sequential/traditional/linear vs onion
	- quality: paper is overstated/sensationalized vs measured/conservative


toy paper
~~~~~~~~~~~
claim:  computers can convince ppl that they're ppl
expt:   100 ppl chat w a chatbot or person, have to decide if chatter is a person or bot
result: 70% of ppl in bot condition said person; 90% of ppl in person cond said person

questions (all mc?)
~~~~~~~~~~~
comp1: what was the author's main conclusion? [choices]
comp2: the author measured whether ppl [enjoyed chatting w a person or bot better]
comp3: the author found that [most ppl could distinguish btwn bot + person]
comp4: the author's hypothesis was that [ppl cannot distinguish btwn bot + person]

crit1: did the experiment prove the author's claim to be true?
crit2: did the experiment provide evidence for the author's claim?
crit3: do you believe the author's main claim is true?
crit4: if this was real, would yr opinion abt author's claim change after reading?

abstract/intro: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
in the modern world, computers are becoming more human-like. however, it is not known whether people are actually convinced by the human-like behavior of computerized agents. in this paper, we prove that modern computers can fool people into thinking that they are actual people. 

methods/materials: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
200 people came into the lab. 100 of them chatted with a person in another room. 100 of them chatted with a chatbot, which is just a computer program designed to interact with ordinary people like another ordinary person. people were then asked if they believed they were chatting with a person or a computer.

results: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
among the people who chatted with a person, 60% believed that they were chatting with a person. among the people who chatted with a computer, 70% believed that they were chatting with a person.

discussion: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
our expt [demonstrated/provided evidence that] that modern computer technology is good enough at mimicking human behavior that it can fool people into thinking it is a human. specifically, people were more likely to believe that the chatbot was human than they were to believe that an actual person was human. this [suggests/proves beyond a shadow of a doubt] that 

conclusion: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
[no concl necessary?]
