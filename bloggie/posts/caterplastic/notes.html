<p>When trying to figure out what the world is like, sometimes I find it useful to try and adopt the perspective of a hypothetical agent who's never had any experience with human society or culture (but nonetheless can speak and read English with native proficiency -- this is a thought experiment after all!). How would such a person understand the way people interact and exchange information with each other? To make the point I want to make, we need another assumption: this guy doesn't have any existing cultural practices to muddle his interpretation of ours; he is a socio-cultural blank slate whose mission is to observe and characterize human interactions. In my imagination, this guy is approximately 4 or 5 inches tall (fitting comfortably into a standard jeans front pocket), looks like a cartoon scientist, and is actually just Professor Frink because I'm not creative enough to make up any more attributes for him.</p>
<p>Take "news" as an example. What is news? Is thar news?! What would lil dude say/think about "news"?!?! I think that through most of American history, most people under most circumstances would imagine Frinkie reporting something like the following: In this world,</p>
<p>And this is in some sense my "null hypothesis" about how the news works -- or rather, how I strongly feel it <em>ought</em> to work: "the news" is a temporal sequence of collections of facts, conveyed with the written word. A "news story" -- itself a sequence of assertions -- is an element of some collection of facts in the eternal temporal sequence that is human documentation of reality. Ultimately, how you would answer this question probably says a lot about <em>your perspective</em> on the news, e.g. whether you find it trustworthy or whether you think it's politically slanted or whether you think it's a hot pile of garbage smoldering its way to obsolescence.</p>
<p>So maybe a better setup to Frink's account is instead: "If you got to decide/control how the whole <em>news</em>-creation and dissemination process works in the world, how would Frink describe it?" I think the way outlined above would be pretty great.^[2] I think most people would agree. So in this post I want to demonstrate just how far we are away from this utopian world.</p>
<p>Based on the XXX's account of a recent article in XXX, I think it's safe to say that the discovery of caterpillars that can digest plastic is:</p>
<pre><code>- something that happened in the world (or at least something we have enough evidence to rationally/reasonably believe happened in the world); 
- something that could conceivably have a non-trivial impact on some aspect of human behavior in the future; 
- something that many would consider "cool" or "crazy" or "clownin"; 
- something that most people would never learn about through direct interaction with other people/things;
- something that anyone could learn if a journalist found it out and published a news story about it; and
- something that many people would be interested by upon learning it.
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, I think it's fair to say that any piece of writing whose primary function is to inform people that some caterpillars can digest plastic should be considered a "news story." Moreover, any such piece should not contain false statements that are directly relevant to the main topic of the story. I'd say this is so even if it appears on an aggregation site and/or contains no "original reporting." And really, if most of these stories are just reporting the reporting of the original news outlet that broke the story, what room could there even be for false statements to creep in?!</p>
<p>Bottom line: people (myself chief among them!) click on the caterpillar-plastic story largely because the headline promises some interesting and important information, and you probably haven't encountered that information before. My goal here is not to complain about the existence of clickbait or to say that the internet is bullshit. I love the internet deeply (yeah, maybe I <em>will</em> marry it). But sometimes the internet acts really dumb and it frustrates the shit out of me. Like in this case, where you have an "accidental" scientific result, produced serendipitously one time at a very small scale and without controlled laboratory conditions. Somehow a very cool but honestly pretty routine-sounding discovery has been distorted into -- quite literally -- .</p>
<p>And so what if the main text of the article backs off from the attention-grabbing (but false) headline -- what proportion of people who <em>see</em> the headline <em>read</em> the story (or even click on it^[3]). And even if they do read the story, what's easier to remember: an outrageous (and false) tagline, or a (true but) nuanced and un-exciting story about a bug eating a hole in some scientist from XXX's plastic shopping bag?</p>
<p>^[3] Fortunately, this quantity could probably be estimated fairly accurately for a particular story, provided that the company publishing the data collects the requisite kinds of user data. Unfortunately, my guess is that they would have very little interest in sharing such information publicly. This would problematic if we were to learn that headlines contained false statements reliably more than the body of articles did (which isn't actually that obvious if you think about it).</p>
<p>^[2] Cool it Mr. Ambitious! This is not meant to apply to stuff on the internet in general -- just "news." As long as it's not posing as "reporting," you don't get to decide how opinion pieces, blogs, fiction, etc. work!</p>

<p>The internet is full of something that smells like information. I'd hesitate to characterize it as "information" though, since I think "information" in the relevant sense -- say, a message conveyed by a piece of language -- tends to imply that the message conveyed is "accurate." I guess this means that to qualify as "information" in the relevant sense, a statement or assertion or sequence of them has to be factual, has to represent some aspect of reality, has to be true, or maybe it has to correspond to a true proposition chillin somewhere with his platonic form buddies (shouts to <em>virtue</em> -- i see u brah). Not trying to develop a new epistimological paradigm here, but hopefully the intuition is clear enough for us to move on now: all occurrences of language contain "information," but that sense of the word is not really what we have in mind when we say things like "I get my information from X news source" or "the internet is a questionable source of information."</p>
<p>The point of all this is that I think this is a major difference between the internet and other, older forms of the written word that most people used to turn to to stay informed about what's happening in the world. For example even thirty years ago, you couldn't read some asshole with a PhD bloviating about the nature of "information" for 1000 words (yeah sorry guys, this got longer than I expected).^[1] Think about what kinds of written materials were available. And then think about consistent and reliable(ish) sources of news. Mostly we had newspapers, magazines, and books for written media; and we had radio and TV for spoken. Now think about how much training, influence, connections, social capital, and/or luck someone had to have to be an author of one of those written materials. Relative to national population size, there used to be waaaaaay less people producing written content that is visible to other people than there are now. The internet has eliminated the barrier to entry: fire up your favorite social media site, tap, tap, tap away, and if you're lucky then more people will read it this week than there were people able to read on this continent just a couple of hundred years ago.</p>
<p>What does this all <em>mean</em> though? The nature of reality definitely isn't changing -- according to science/definition, the world works pretty much the same way now as it has for billions of years. Sure there's lots more weird hairless bipedes doing weird hairless bipede stuff and building weird hairless bipede machines, but the fabric of the universe is as stiff as it comes. So what's changing? I conjecture that what's changing with respect to how we interact with written information is <em>not enough</em>. What <em>should</em> be changing is our default mindset when we encounter some words on a page or on a screen. What we've been thinking by default for generations is probably something like "Okay, the person who wrote this gets paid to report facts. They've probably been doing this job for some years now, so they must not be messing up too bad, so probably what I'm about to read is mostly true. And if it's not, then the paper will print a retraction or I'll hear that it's bogus somewhere around town." What I'd argue we should be thinking by default <em>today</em> is something closer to this: "Who wrote this and for what company? What were the author's motivations for writing it and the company's for publishing it? What is the person who wrote this incentivized by, and what would the company like to see happen with the article?" Entering a sequence of assertions with this attitude can have the effect of leading you to question each assertion individually: "How does the author know X is true? Have other people also asserted X? Have other people described the same set of events by making assertions that are incompatible with X being the case?" I've found that the answers to these questions are often dismaying. I think that the news nowadays is largely a form of entertainment, with precision and accuracy taking a backseat to stuff that gets clicks/views/rt's/etc. This is not an original thought. But here's something you may never have thought about:</p>
<p>^[1] This analogy is complicated by the fact that much of internet-based news is now video or audio instead of text. But even so, a lot if not most of that stuff is pre-written and copy-edited, like a newspaper story partially chewed and regurgitated into our little baby birdie mouths by our overlord parent, ever reliable mama internet.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where we're supposed to interpret assertions as putative [proffered(?) genuine(?)] descriptions of reality (or relevant bits thereof).</p>
<p>Imagine that this interpretive strategy is assumed to be especially reliable when an assertion (i) is coming from a trusted authority; (ii) is intended to supply factual information; and (iii) has been meticulously planned (e.g. it is <em>written</em> and not spoken).</p>
<p>Now further imagine that in this wacky world, people often release large sequences of assertions in written form, the first of which (crudely) summarizes the entire content of the sequence of assertions, and is usually by far the most visually prominent assertion in the sequence.</p>
<p>What's more is that for any given event that's worth describing, a bunch of different people will all try their hand at churning out descriptions of that event.</p>
<p>And finally, imagine that millions of people read several such sequences every day -- coming across many times more along the way. When someone "comes across" but doesn't read a sequence, what usually happens is that they read that first assertion (the prominent one), and then decide -- for any of a littany of potential reasons -- not to continue reading.</p>
<p>In this society, some people spend most of their time crafting these sequences of assertions, and are rewarded handsomely for supplying consistently good material. In fact, the reward someone gets for writing a sequence is <em>directly proportional</em> to the number of people who read that sequence -- irrespective of whether or not people enjoyed it or believed it to be an accurate description of reality.</p>
<p>We can ask a lot of questions about this kind of a world. For example we can ask about the degree to which different people's descriptions of a common event coincide.</p>
<p>A question I'd like to ask about this paradisic reality is the following: "if many people build their own sequences of assertions putatively describing the same phenomenon or event, what degree of consistency should we expect across different people's most prominent (initial) assertions?"</p>
<p>When I say "consistency" here, what I have in mind is <em>logical</em> consistency: roughly, statements $A$ and $B$ are consistent when they don't form or lead to a contradiction. For example "roses are red" is consistent with "violets are blue" (and maybe even "roses are blue"), but it's not consistent with "roses are not red." It's also consistent with just about any sentence that doesn't (in)directly contradict or logically follow from it.</p>
<p>I used to think -- or at least hope -- that this was the world we all lived in. Anymore, I'm pretty sure that's wrong though.</p>

<p>let's suppose all the headline statements are true (see <code>linxe.md</code>). what can be logically inferred from them? i.e. what are we <em>compelled</em> to believe if we accept that each headline is true?</p>
<p>q1: how many linked to the paper?
q2: is the paper available online?
q3: do ppl link to "originally reported by"?
q4:</p>
