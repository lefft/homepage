    <p> <strong>Abstract</strong> 
    <br>Jaclyn will be presenting some crosstabs and preliminary regression results from an experimental vignette survey question. The vignette describes a dual-career couple in which one partner gets offered a job in another city. Respondents answer questions about what they think the couple should do. [She] needs feedback for thinking about how to analyze and interpret these data.</p>  </li>

    <p> <strong>Abstract</strong> 
    <br> Here is a problem that can arise when analyzing certain kinds of samples of a numeric variable: a large number of data points cluster at the maximum or minimum of the relevant scale, but the distribution is otherwise mostly as expected (e.g. normal, uniform, etc). This situation presents a number of challenges for interpretability and model selection, and cannot always be remedied by standard transformations like log or arcsine. In this presentation I will illustrate an instance of this problem that I recently encountered in child vocabulary data. I will show how censored ("tobit") regression models provide a reasonable solution to this problem, using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VGAM/">VGAM package</a> in R (Yee et al., <a href="doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7">2015</a>). Time permitting, I will demonstrate how to decompose tobit model coefficients so that they can be read (almost) like more familiar OLS coefficients. </p> </li>
